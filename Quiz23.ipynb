At a glace, we can see that the democrats supported the action almost by double when you compare it with the republicans and the independent party, however, if we take a closer look, there is only 8% difference between democrats vote (62%) and the other two(52%). The vertical axix starts at 50 which should actually start at a zero. This is one of the perfect example showing the bad representation of data in a bargraph."

One of the bargraph on the left seeems to me more organized in scale basis compared to the one on the right. The datasets representing minor difference between each other must be represented in appropriate scale. As the interest rates from differnt lenders vary but the difference is minimal and to show such minimal difference in a precised manner the decimal places after 3 has been broken down into minor sections. But in the graph on the right all the interest rates looks the same and it is misleading. "
