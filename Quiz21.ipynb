Dr. John Snow was able to interpret the source of outbreak, affected area and the number of deaths in the area by collecting the data and recording it on his map which helped in illustrating the vivid picture in easily understandable way. In the given map, the number of death is represented by the bar and water pumps are indicated by the dots."

The modern interpretation of map with the help of computing power and modern analisis gives us more informatiom compared ot the older version. This image actually shows the exact same information with more understandabilty to the viwer. The image uses Voronoi polygon and cluster analysis overlay which allows to form the variety of color symbolising the intensity, number of deaths, population affected and the source of wells.\n"
