        "For the project Recent Visualization, I am choosing the topic UEFA Champions League 2021-2022. UEFA Champions League (UCL) is the Europe's premier club football tournament which is organized anually by the Union of European Football Association (UEFA). A total of 32 teams will be competing in the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League with a dream of winning the most prestigious trophy in professional club football.  \n",

        "Since UCL is one of the famous sports broadcasted all over the world through different sports channels, I believe most of my classmates are familiar with it. I will be focusing on how tv/sports channel from Manchester, England portrays the champions leaguge with that of Madrid, Spain. I am already getting into researching the local channels and news papers to see how things are different in people living in different regions of Europe. The topic I chose  will be appropriate as I can find many visualization and datasets to work with. Since, I watch all game live on my laptop I can tell whether or not the information/visuals found on web while doing my research are representing honest facts or just some misleading information.\n",

        "While doing this project, I hope to learn how to critic on a data visualization. I can carefully look at the graph or heat map or some other visuals and tell if it is representing a good or bad information. I will aslo learn to broaden my skill of researching and gathering data from the web. \n",

The visualization also gives the information about the starting line up style ( 4-2-3-1 for madrid and 4-3-3 for Man city),position of a player. For example No. 9 is playing as the striker, no. 1 as a goal keeeper etc. The green up sign and the red down sign represents the players surrent rating going up or down. \n"
